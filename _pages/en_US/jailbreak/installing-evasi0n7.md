Evasi0n is capable of jailbreaking all devices on iOS 7.0 to 7.0.6

Evasi0n is an untethered jailbreak, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device.

In order to use Evasi0n, you will need a Windows computer running Windows 7 or newer and the patched version of the original evasi0n7.exe so that it can fetch jailbreak files from the internet.

<!-- Technically you can run it on Mojave or older but I don't have access to that so I can't write about it -->

## Installing Evasi0n7

If your device has been OTA updated to its current version of iOS 7, you may encounter a bootloop
{: .notice--warning}

1. Open patched-with-ipg-link-evasi0n7.exe
1. Plug your device into your computer and trust the computer on device when prompted
1. Click on jailbreak in Evasi0n7
   - it may take a moment for the required files to download
1. Once your phone has rebooted once, open the Evasi0n app on your home screen
1. Once your phone has rebooted again, unlock your device. Evasi0n will reboot your device one last time and you will see the evasi0n logo on your phone as it boots up

Once you see your lock screen, you should be jailbroken. Cydia will be on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install [tweaks](faq#tweaks), themes and more.
